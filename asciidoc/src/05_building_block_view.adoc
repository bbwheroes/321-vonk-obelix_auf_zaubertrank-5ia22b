|Zipkin

|Distributed tracing

|Prometheus

|Metrics collection (5s scrape interval)

|Watchtower
|—
|Auto-updates containers every 30s
|===

==== CI/CD Pipeline

// TODO: Describe pipeline triggers and workflow

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Stage |Description

|Build
|GitHub Actions builds Docker images

|Push
|Images pushed to GitHub Container Registry

|Deploy
|Watchtower detects new images and redeploys automatically
|===

==== Operational Characteristics

Automatic Updates::
Watchtower polls ghcr.io every 30 seconds. When a new `:latest` image is detected, the container is automatically replaced.

Observability::
* **Tracing**: All backend services send traces to Zipkin
* **Metrics**: Prometheus scrapes `/actuator/prometheus` every 5 seconds

Data Persistence::
None. All data is ephemeral and lost when the VM is reprovisioned.

// TODO: Add information about VM specs, network access, and security once available
