=== _CI/CD Pipeline Concept_

==== Motivation

The application consists of multiple Spring Boot–based microservices that are developed and maintained independently.
To ensure consistent quality and reliable delivery, an automated CI/CD pipeline is required.

The CI/CD pipeline addresses the following needs:

* Early detection of errors through automated testing
* Consistent and reproducible builds for all microservices
* Fast feedback for developers on code changes
* Automated creation and delivery of container images
* Centralized storage of deployment artifacts in GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

Manual testing and manual container builds would be error-prone, slow, and difficult to scale in a microservice-based architecture.

---

==== Solution

A centralized CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and defined as code within the repository.

The pipeline follows a simple and clear workflow:

* Source code changes are pushed to the repository
* Automated tests are executed in the CI pipeline
* Container images are built only if all tests pass
* Successfully built images are pushed to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

This ensures that only tested and verified artifacts are published and available for deployment.
