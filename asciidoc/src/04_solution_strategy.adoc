=== CI/CD Pipeline — Context and Scope

==== Test, Build, and Push Pipeline (GHCR)

The CI/CD pipeline provides automated build and test processes for the
Spring Boot–based microservices and produces container images as deployable
artifacts.

It integrates with the source code repository and the GitHub Container
Registry (GHCR) and serves as the bridge between development and downstream
deployment processes.

This section describes the system context of the CI/CD pipeline and defines
its scope within the overall system.

=== Elements in Context

* **Developer**  
  Creates and modifies application code and initiates pipeline execution by
  pushing changes or opening pull requests.

* **Git Repository (GitHub)**  
  Stores application source code and CI/CD pipeline definitions and triggers
  pipeline runs based on repository events.

* **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**  
  Builds the application, executes automated tests, and produces container
  images.

* **Container Registry (GHCR)**  
  Stores versioned container images generated by the CI/CD pipeline.

=== Scope

The CI/CD pipeline covers the following responsibilities:

* Source code checkout
* Build and dependency management
* Automated testing (unit and integration tests)
* Container image build
* Publication of container images to GHCR
