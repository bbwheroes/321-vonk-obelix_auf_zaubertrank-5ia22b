== Quality Requirements


=== Quality Requirements Overview (Infrastructure)

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Priority |Description

|Deployability
|High
|New code changes must be automatically deployed within 1 minute of pushing to main

|Observability
|High
|All backend services must expose metrics and traces for debugging

|Simplicity
|High
|Infrastructure must be reproducible from a single cloud-init script

|Availability
|Medium
|System should auto-recover from container crashes

|Data Durability
|Low
|Data persistence is not required (demo/school project)
|===


=== Quality Scenarios

==== Scenario 1: Continuous Deployment

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Attribute |Deployability

|Source
|Developer pushes code to `main` branch

|Stimulus
|Code change merged

|Environment
|GitHub Actions + MaaS VM

|Response
|Watchtower detects new image and restarts container

|Measure
|New version running within 60 seconds of image push
|===

==== Scenario 2: Container Recovery

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Attribute |Availability

|Source
|Container crash (OOM, application error)

|Stimulus
|Container exits unexpectedly

|Environment
|Docker on MaaS VM

|Response
|Docker restarts container automatically (`restart: unless-stopped`)

|Measure
|Container restarts within 10 seconds
|===

==== Scenario 3: Debugging Production Issues

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Attribute |Observability

|Source
|Developer investigating slow requests

|Stimulus
|User reports slow response time

|Environment
|Running system

|Response
|Developer can view distributed traces in Zipkin and metrics in Prometheus

|Measure
|Traces available within 5 seconds, metrics scraped every 5 seconds
|===

==== Scenario 4: Infrastructure Recreation

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Attribute |Simplicity

|Source
|VM expires after 1 month

|Stimulus
|Need to redeploy system

|Environment
|MaaS platform

|Response
|Provision new VM with same cloud-init script

|Measure
|Full system running within 5 minutes of VM boot
